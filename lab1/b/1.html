        <h1>About them</h1>
        <p>Collies form a distinctive type of <em>herding</em > dogs, including many related landraces and standardized breeds. The type originated in Scotland and Northern England. Collies are medium-sized, fairly lightly-built dogs, with pointed snouts. Many types have a distinctive white color over the shoulders. Collies are very active and agile, and most types of collies have a very strong herding instinct. Collie breeds have spread through many parts of the world (especially <strong> Australia and North America</strong>), and have diversified into many varieties, sometimes mixed with other dog types.</p>
