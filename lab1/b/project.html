        <p>Paris, <em>the city of Lights</em>, <em>the fashion capital, the city of Love</em>. All these nicknames are far from enough to reveal all of Paris.</p>

<p id = "info">Paris is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. It is known worldwide for the Louvre Museum, Notre-Dame cathedral, and the <strong>Eiffel tower</strong>. It has a reputation of being a romantic and cultural city. The city is also known for its high-quality gastronomy and the terraces of its cafés.</p>
<p><strong>Five places to visit near Paris</strong></p><br>

<h1>Musée du Louvre</h1>
<p><strong class = "Top">Top choice</strong> in Paris</p>
<img src = "https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2021-04/shutterstockRF_1035503722.jpg?auto=format&w=640&h=360&ar=16:9&fit=crop&crop=center&format=auto&q=75" width = "500" height = "400">
<p>The Louvre is famously crowded—it is the most-visited museum in the world, after all. But even if you aren’t willing to fight a hundred camera-wielding tourists to see the Mona Lisa, at least stroll past the museum to see I.M. Pei’s famous glass pyramid.</p>

<h2>River Seine</h2>

<p>The River Seine is essentially the beating heart of Paris, bordering half of the French capital's arrondissements. We’re partial to views of the river at dusk, but thanks to a few recent additions—a floating hotel and pedestrian-only walkway, for starters—the watery pathway is pretty damn gorgeous around the clock.</p>

<h3>Jardin des Tuileries</h3>

<p>This perfectly manicured park also has the advantage of a perfect location—turn one direction and you'll find the Louvre, turn the other, Place de la Concorde. Walk the entire length to really admire the formal French garden design of the 17th century.</p>

<h4>Musée d'Orsay</h4>
<img src="https://media.cntraveler.com/photos/57d87670248d564c67def52f/master/w_1920%2Cc_limit/most-beautiful-paris-musee-dorsay-GettyImages-596217038.jpg" width="500" height="400">
<p>A vast collection of Impressionist artworks is the focus at the Musée d’Orsay, Paris’s second most-visited museum. But don’t forget to look past the artwork for a moment to admire the arched ceiling, a reminder of the building’s past as a train station.</p>

<h5>Arc de Triomphe</h5>
<img src="https://media.cntraveler.com/photos/5bad30730fe9cc17fd8a47e1/master/w_1920%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-513799096.jpg" width="500" height="400">
<p>As if the views of the Arc de Triomphe aren’t stunning enough, the views from the Arc de Triomphe are even more incredible. It's a pretty claustrophobic climb to the top, but the fresh air and 360-degree views of Paris are well worth it.</p>
